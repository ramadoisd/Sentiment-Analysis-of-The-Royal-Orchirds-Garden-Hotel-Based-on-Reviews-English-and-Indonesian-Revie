Review
"this is old hotel but they still have a great maintenance. surrounded with mauntain and have a nice garden. weather is good, quite and good service from the staff. for breakfast is good with a lot of food"
The pool and garden very nice.The room is spacious and very clean.The staff so friendly.Combine with green view.They have tasty pizza too.I will definitely will be come back to this hotel but for vacation.
"Stayed 3 night with my family, room is clean and all staff very friendly. Need a small touch for maintenance, but overall is good. I will recommend this hotel to my friend. Hopefully can stay here again."
"We visited this hotel on weekend, like most hotel ini Batu, the air is very fresh. It is located in the center of Batu City, only 7 mins from Alun-Alun Batu. The parking space in the hotel yard is very large. The room is pretty spacious, it has balcony with beautiful view. It feels nice to sit on the balcony in the morning or afternoon just watching the view.  TV channel is okay, but not enough electric plug if you bring more than 1 mobile phone. It has refrigerator. Breakfast is very good, plenty of good food with view to the pool. And the pool is also beautiful and surprisingly not as cold as I thought, the water is clean without chlorine smell (you can relax at the pool side) and they have locker, towel, hot water shower near the pool.They have mini garden and zoo in which they kept animals like birds and chickenThe facilities are worth the price, definitely will come back to this nice hotel"
"We stay at Junior Executive Room..a very recommended for family with three children like us..with small living room and dining place. The breakfast has a large range of variation..I love their ""Bubur Jawa, nasi pecel, gorengan, bolu...""however for othe menu I think the taste can be enhanced as well. The pool is cold and no towel provided (a little bit service need to be provided here). Better they provide warm pool as well considering the location in the cold area in Batu. Otherwise people will start looking for hotel or house with no pool facility because the main reason come to Batu is to visit Jatim Park. If they provide warm pool, it could be an added value for people to choose this hotel even during low season.All the best for this hotel in the future."
"I stayed in this hotel for business with my colleagues in the last weekend of September 2018. I stayed in the room number 230. It is a nice bedroom with nice view to the garden. it has small balcony and equipped with coffeemaker. I checked the bathroom and I found my self enjoy the heavy flow of toilet water and shower.I did not see any lift nor elevator to the higher story so I was thankful that my room was on the same floor as the reception desk. There was welcome drink provided near the desk and it was certainly for free. I did have warm ginger drink at that time. The next morning I went from one buffet to the others and I thought that the breakfast menu was ordinary. Local breakfast dishes were served such as pecel and bubur ayam and I decided to arrange my own breakfast menu. I picked this and that and they did not match on my plate but who cares? :)The dinner was nice and I enjoyed the red soup. But as I was going to take the chicken salad, I tried to find pieces of chicken meat and I failed. I asked the waiter and he said that the dish label was wrong. It should have been typed fruit salad. :)"
"Old hotel,but nice environment, helpful and hospitality staff. The cost including dinner and breakfast. Variable menu for breakfast,just need to improve on the taste, but the menu it self are ok. Unfortunately we only stay one night"
"I stayed for one night and booked for 2 executive rooms and cost me around IDR 3. 6mio... booked from Agoda. Hotel location is quite far from Jatim Park complex around 4,4 km but it is on the way to Coban Rondo area.I arrived at night around 10 o'clock. We had to picked our luggages by ourself from car to the rooms since nobody around for help.The rooms itself its quite spacious, it's has a dinning area and sofa, yet no extra bed as advertised. When we asked to have extra bed the hotel ask for 600K additional charge. If you stayed with 2 children expect to have a sleep on a small couch unless you willing to pay more. This room had standard amenities and include free snacks and drinks from Mayora. The room is clean and quite well maintenance. Bath room is spacious has shower and bathtub. The shower door is broken thou so the water from shower is sprayed on the bathroom floor each time we had a shower.Breakfast is included, the restaurant is quite big. They serve variety of foods but the taste is need big improvement. Egg corner is serve by one person so you have to be patient just to get an omelet. Juice is not fresh fruits. The hotel also have huge swimming pool and a garden with children playground. The pool is clean but Batu weather is cold so people tend to not stay too long in the pool. So in general, the hotel is not really bad but is not good either. Yet for the price they charge over the service and facilities they provided  it is way too much. Soon if the management did not make big improvement in services  lower this hotel will soon become a forgotten one."
"This is old hotel. The room is small, by default they has 1 extra bed in the room. So for 3 people its ok. But if you need another one that would be expensive compare to the room price.They has a big garden and mini zoo, i dont know much about condos, since i only rent for hotel room."
"I take one night stay in this hotel with nice and helpfull of the bellboy. They arrange my luggage and needs very well.The room is clean, but need improvement in bathroom about the shower permanent wall, may be can be change with flexible shower. The swimming pool is big and clean, maybe for some people its old fashion pool but for me its clean and well maintain.The breakfast menu is so variaty.This hotel suitable for family too."
"Convenient for family, food is delicioius, large swimming pool split by age and depth , a bit old building but still in good maintenance , so many collection of birds to enjoy our holiday near swimming pool"
"The grounds of the hotel were quite breathtaking, but sadly the shower took much too long to heat up and the food was middling. Some documents left behind by the last guest weren't removed when I checked in, despite several hours having passed since said guest checked out. Given the average cost of rooms, I would expect much better service."
"This hotel is nice place with amazing scenery, but i feel rather spooky because my room was on first floor that was very quite, and there was little damage on my room wall. But overall, the service was good."
"I stayed at week end period with high expectation to receive 4 star value of services. Cek in is flow less and warm staff. Room amenities, towel are good, but need improvement in room lighting (too dark), lack of electric socket and tv is too small compare to room size as well as limited chanel. Breakfast experience, hmmm menu is limited and very crowded with groups (there are 2 buses) I am affraid because of this situation so the hotel down grade the breakfast quality (maybe?). we plan to swim, but too crowd with staff party (17 an?) which disturb us while pool equipment such as table, chairs and parasol are dirty and too old not as good as the advertisement."
"Having checked trip advisor's rank & friend's recommendation, I stayed at this hotel. One of the consideration due  this hotel close to Museum Angkot. Good value are : security in gate is good/polite, Check in process  as simple is that, warm greeting from staffs, room amenities are very good, huge room, parking lot is okay, small nice garden. Several things need improvement : Spool is too old there are items need replacement such as table & chair , breakfast quality is poor, environment crowded, carpet cleanliness  along corridor is dusty, in my room there are mosquito & need reading lamp, AC position direct the bed room which will have negative effect. GBU"
"The personnel is very friendly and try to help you in any way.  The garden is great! It has nice plants, birds and other animals. You can take your time to enjoy it. The playgarden has many attributes but it needs an update (not broken but it's old). The breakfast is very good and has a great variety of choices. I mainly use the international part of the breakfast and than there could be some more types of spread like chocolat paste. But when you like warm food in the morning (like my wife and kids) than there's a lot of choice.  The pool is big and has the choice between a baby, kids and an adult pool (2m). Especially the last one is not available in most hotels. On the other hand the pool and the attributes around it need an update. It is old and certain things are broken but"
"Exellent service... cozy n nice place to stay... Have breakfast time, tea time n dinner...  For me i will stay in this place again when a go to batu. The food is tasty... my children love it.  The pool is fun for my children."
"Stayed for 3 days with family. Overall: hotel is good. Food is great, hotel staffs are fully hearted when serve us.  I booked via Agoda and no problem at all during the process and stay period.  Hotel view are great. Area for improvement : hotel facilities & amenities."
"Big hotel with great pool, pretty garden and play ground too. Comfort and clean bed, complete amenities, clean towel. Delicuous breakfast, great hospitality of staffs. Unfornately, with its pricey, we have  very slow wifi, and also need maintenance for the bath room."
"i stayed in May 19th 2017 with my family from Australia. Honestly this was my first time stayed in this hotel. i'm so impressed how the staff treat me so special, very warm and recommended hotel,this hotel looka so old but i'm happy to stay here even just for spending weekend, they have like some nice night pool dining with live band, and fun activities in Sunday in breakfast time. Recommended hotel,nice and friendly staff love it !! overall was good i like this hotel,but pleased give an air conditioner in Superior Room and made more hotel activities for guest.. It's fun and attracting..thank's Royal Orchid Garden Hotel.."
"Wonderful hotel to stay, various cuisines. Marvelous mountains view, fresh air, close to many destination including, hot spring, Selecta park, waterfalls, museums, paragliding sport, zoo, and amusement parks."
"Everything was so great.. it is cozy, luxurious hotel and room for sure.. You will feel the clear air every morning from your room, swimming pool was super, garden and playground were great as well.. Don't question about the hospitality, they're awesome and also the receptionists speak English*.. Food was super as well.  Overall we were so satisfied being there for couple of days.  *fluency not granted"
"I come back to Batu after years ago visit in my childhood. Staying in this hotel is the first time, and ... it is a strike three call disappointment. Our room is in the newer building far back but no AC. It's ok without AC, we can open the windows for a cooler air. Nice ... wait, how about the mosquitos? I find out no net installed. So, I have to call few times before it gets installed. The bed is ok, yet the tv is not as clear as we expect. Maybe signal problem (Batu is in the highland, it doesn't make if the hotel has a signal problem). Next, bathroom. Initially I have problem flushing the toilet. Thank God the fix it. Another problem is the soap. They provide solid, round soap and ... it is small! It's not good for taking shower; it feels not enough covering your body. The"
"This hotel is actually old, but it has been fully renovated. Our room is satisfying (just a bit distracted with the wall color -- ours is green and orange!). It's clean overall and not smelly, though there's pen stain on our bedsheet. Bathroom is okay, just the amenities aren't replaced completely daily. For example when I needed the sanitary bag at that time and I should ask for it first. The swimming pool is nice. The parking lot is huge. The park and surrounding is pretty and refreshing. The breakfast? There's quite a lot variety of food (local, oriental, and international) and egg station. However, mostly the food is local and oriental. The toast isn't really fresh, and the jam tastes not good (it tastes cheap priced jam). The staff? Most of them are friendly and helpful,"
"Good air good weather, nice pool. Nice people very polite. The food not good.. almost horrible. The room quite big but its old fashioned. Must upgrade the cleanliness of the room. The bathroom quite nice the toilet clean enough."
Stay away from this hotel! It is so overpriced! My family book 3 executive rooms and stay for 2 nights. We had problems since the moment we checked in. They have the worst service in the world. They have ridiculous rules which gonna make your stay unpleasant. The rooms are old. The furnitures are old and some are broken. They are also damped. The curtain in 322 were teared up but they don't bother to change it. The sofa and carpet were dusty and stained by lizards poo. I was sneezing non stop during the stay.  Don't stay here seriously! We won't come back here in the future
"this is a nice place to stay away from your daily routines. surrounded with a nice view, your stay here will be memorable. they have various kind of rooms that will suit your budget. they also have a good menus for breakfast. their staff have good manners and also helpful. i had a very nice experience during my stay here. definitely a place you should consider while visiting Batu."
This is the first time I come to Batu also the first time to stay in this hotel.The room is clean. The view from my room (314) is nice..at night I can see the light from the downtown..I recomended to stay here
"From the moment of arrival staff were friendly and efficient and nothing was too much trouble for them. Yes the hotel is not new but maintenance is ongoing and any small problems were given a quick response. Very clean and constant supply of all kinds of food at breakfast.  good size rooms, the only down side was the mountain view rooms get quite a bit of traffic noise. I would recommend to other travelers of all types although it is more of a family hotel. I found the shower faucet confusing but plenty of hot water if it is turned the correct way."
"The Royal Orchids is in need of a makeover. Many of the facilities are dated and in need of repair. The pool is no longer heated. It does not feel like much has changed over the years other than the signs of wear and tear. Screens in the room damaged, pulls for the curtains missing. It seems like no one cares about repair and maintenance."
"Quick check in process handled by Ms. Chaterine. Quick service by the housekeeping (i ordered 2 extrabed when check in, after that the housekeeping already in front of my room when we want to go inside the room), quick service too from the engineering team coz we have some trouble with the tv. Room was really spacious.   Breakfast really tasty, but at 8.30am just arrived at the restaurant but some of the food already cold and not refill yet especially the crispy chicken (forgot its name). Another problem is about the swimming pool. I think its really too early to close the swimming pool at 5pm. At 4.35pm my sister and my nephew just got inside the pool and then at 4.45pm someone from the pool staff said that 5pm will close. So my sister and nephew can only swim not more than"
"I stayed at a superior room and I think it's not worthed the price because the room is old enough..the hotel management should turn some parts of the bedroom & the bathroom with the new one. But there's one thing that make me satisfied, the food!! They serve the guest with many kinds of menu..From traditional food/drink such as pecel, nasi liwet, jamu until sushi, hotdog, etc.. 2 thumbs up for the breakfast!!"
"Well maintained and offers all necessary amenities and facilities. When we arrived, the check in was very swift and efficient. The location is near a convenient store and foods stalls. There is a narrow road and no sidewalk in front of the hotel that walking to the nearby restaurant is bit challenging, but is still manageable. The condo that we stayed was very comfortable but having the room on the second second floor was bit challenging for my father who has knee problem. The view from the room is gorgeous, facing the city mayor office and the city."
"Fast response,really attentive to the guest. During my stay in orchids they knew what my family and I need to make my stay more comfortable. Next time I will recommend this hotel to my colleagues. Success for orchids hotel."
"Check in procedure was quick. But I just wondering why should They kept their guest ID card? We had full paid our room and put some money as deposit. I've never   had experienced like that in another hotel. I booked 2 Deluxe room via online travel agent. The room was very clean, and tidy. We get free dinner and breakfast. The dinner was awesome and delicious, unfortunately the breakfast was so standard and the taste wasn't so good at all. The coffee and the fried rice was the worst.  They have a large and beautiful swimming pool(kids pool&adult pool)except there is no hot water pool(which is dissapointed my kids so much). The hotel's garden is large and beautiful and also there is kids playground.  The staffs is nice , warm and very helpful; they helped my old mother who was"
"Every year when we visit Batu, we always staying at Royal Orchids Garden Hotel (we had our traditional wedding there too) as it location is convenient for me to be close to my family, BUT every year the hotel looks tired and getting old (except for the entrance of the hotel, the only thing that has been maintain).  The executive room (where we normally booked to stay) needs to be refresh a little.  The one thing that always ticked me off is their hot water; after 6pm the hot water seems being turn off as we never get decent hot water for shower.  For hotel with 4 stars (as it claimed) the guests should be able to have hot shower at anytime. We did report about the problem but nothing being fix (even though the front office advised us to wait about 5 minutes for hot water to"
"very easy to find . Wonderful scenery from the room's balcony. friendly staffs . reasonable price , pay the room , get breakfast & dinner for free.  many choice of breakfast & fresh food.  mini market just beside the hotel ."
"This hotel is typical old hotel, big, with plenty of space for huge swimming pool and play ground, but this aspect is what makes the maintenance of this facilities is much more difficult, even thought the hotel try to maintain this place I can see, that some part of this hotel is"" untouched"", grass is not properly mowed, carpet in the hallway is old and dirty, and also some wall has stain in it My room has been modernized with flat screen tv and new decoration, but they haven't touch the bathroom , so the bathroom looks very old, and also the balcony area, the doors and the windows, and also, no AC =), for you that consider ac is a must, and don't stay at this hotel (the hotel should also aware that batu is not as cold as when the hotel is build) And now for the positive side,"
"The staff are warm and welcomed.. The food they served are up to standard. great place to stay for business trip. 3 days with great service and good food is a must for me,they did not disappoint any of my friends."
"quick check in proses, I get a room that I want at that time with an amazing view. I can see a light in the mountain from my room in the night that was beautiful. breakfast is good all alot of varian. and nice staff."
All ok after upgrade. And staff so friendly but too hot because no air conditioning. Room ok and clean. But the safety box too old and difficult to use. Breakfast good and many choices. I think it's ok for short holiday. And thanks for the fruit and cake :)
"staying in this hotel for weekend last week, feel very satisfied, large swimming pool, spacious room, tidy and clean, delicious food, staffs are very warm welcome and keep smiling everytime. very highly recommended for everyone whom passing batu by. thank you royal orchid."
"At first, I came to Malang I search for a unique hotel and I found a interested hotel the hotel was Royal Orchid Garden, in there I stay at executive room at number 308. The view directly to Arjuna Mountain looks so beautiful. And in the room already had minibar. And the room very fresh to breathe. The cleanliness so perfect I don't saw a rubbish in room, in bedroom there is already animal folding like a elephant."
I visited last month with my family. Royal is so wide and green. The weather is cold but ok. This place makes me feel like at home. Not only has a good view but also nice staff. Very comfortable. So far so good. We all had a good time here. Thank you Royal.
Last month I visited batu and stayed at Royal orchids hotel. It was better than I visited before. I really surprised when I got a welcome cookies in my room. Oh my God that's so sweet there was a welcome letter and my name put on there. The hotel's service made me Feels like at my own home. Thank you royal I really love it. Hope you have the same nice experience guys😉
I'm visit with my wife at this hotel. Room very clean and view of Panderman mountain is very good. We enjoy with this hotel and food restaurant very good. I will visit at this hotel next time. But wifi in my room not good and very slow.
"Great Family atmosphere. The slides and activities for the children were amazing, The Staff were so friendly and helpful. Breakfast is delicious and the Javanese Food is really tasty. The pool area is really good, Perfect place for Holiday."
"- First time visit Batu, with my family, and my friend recommend this hotel for stay - Relaxing & Cold Hotel - Standard size room, but look not maintain regularly - Room also not really clean - Standard choice of breakfast - Swimming pool is very large, the water freeze us - location quite far from Batu famous attraction, JATIM PARK"
"First time visited at Royal Orchid Malang It's So cloudy, cleans for rooms, nice situation, calm, and enjoyed it Swimming pool it's so big,  not far if wanna next visited the other place can make me have fun  happy family, happy holiday :D"
"The hotel offers good price for meeting package. Outdoor Facilities and staffs, are good. Hospitality is well met. Helpful. Food is relatively good. Breakfast is great.  We enjoy the stay and make our  meetings productive. Thanks to the hotel management."
"Despite claiming this resort is 4 stars, as with most resort in this area, the resort is closer to 3 stars.  Pros : + Price is quite affordable, as compared to other ""4 stars"" + Location is in the Batu town central  Cons : + Rooms and dining area is somewhat damp. + Windows is not equipped with ""anti mosquito screens"" + Bathroom is only ONE for 2 bed rooms (4 pax) + Bathroom is not spotless clean, as 4 stars should do."
Green and the weather is so cool. The price is quite cheap. The pool is nice and big but a little bit dirty. room already furnished but still dirty and old. The food tasteless although the have many choices. They have a singer accompany your breakfast. Cool. Overall this should be a great hotel if they can manage the second lobby as well
"Superior Room  Cons: - Malang Taxi driver have no idea where is the hotel located, use Maps. - No AC for Superior room, but its OK. - Only twin beds, but you can join it.  Pros: - Tasty breakfast. - Good pool, even for kids. - Fast check in and checkout. - Helpful staff"
"This place is very wide, green and the weather is so cool. The price is quite cheap. The pool is nice and big but a little bit dirty. The water in the pool is good enough just at the perfect temperature, don't worry your children get cold. They have play ground and it good and maintenance well. They also have mini zoo. Unfortunately we got room in the second lobby not in the main lobby. The room already furnished but still dirty and old. The food tasteless although the have many choices. They have a singer accompany your breakfast. Cool. Overall this should be a great hotel if they can manage the second lobby as well."

"When We Visited The Hotel 2 days before moslem new year, we cant find anymore un-booked hotel, But at last  we found one affordable hotel that is this hotel we go visit the hotel, the lobby was pretty quiet, we saw some people check in the hotel. First we ask for the payment for a superior room, the service was pretty bad, and something worse happens when we tried to do a payment using Mandiri Credit Card, it machine said it failed and the receptionist clicked the machine again, it also says it fails. After that we though that using credit card it would discount us. But then we contact the Mandiri Service and they told us that we paid twice, we shocked and we gave the phone to the receptionist, the mandiri service has told the receptionist to do stuff but still it can't, so we"
"Hotel is located in Batu, Malang, Java East. Check in was fast. The receptionist was friendly. The room was clean. The mattress and pillow were comfortable. However, the door to the balcony was old and very difficult to close and open (room 238). It always have to be pushed really hard and close with a bang, thus disturbing other guests. It is the same with the bathroom door. The rooms are not sound proof, and you can hear other guests talking. There was no air conditioning or fan as the weather was cool. Water heater is available. Wifi quality is very poor. There is no signal in the room. It is only available in the lobby and restaurant. The restaurant serve a nice spread of Indonesian delicacies during the weekend. However on weekdays, the choice was less, likely due to the"
"Well, I was here for the first time.This hotel is very awesome!the room is so clean and also very comfort. I was here with my family in my trip. When I lost to looking for my room, I met a person name Mr. Suharmoko, he showed me where my room was. He is a nice person. And then also...every morning the roomboy always clean my room (cause I stayed here 3 nights), so I just say ""very nice hotel"". Thx Royal Orchids Garden Hotel P.S : the balcony is very awesome, u better check that out."
"(+) room quite comfort and clean, friendly staff, big hotel, spacious parking lot, quite near from amusement park (jatim park, museum angkut,etc.) (-) no elevator / lift, and we have to walk quite far to our room, low wifi signal in our room (lower ground)"
"Royal Orchid is one of the hotels in Batu. The scenery that we can see is very beautiful one. One of which is the mountains. We could see the mountains and Panderman  Mountain and Arjuna Mountain. In addition, we also feel the atmosphere of the quiet and fresh air in the around the area of the hotel. Furthermore, the service provided is very satisfactory. for example, workers in the hotel are very friendly, courteous, reasonably clean environment, there are some games for children to play, and there is a zoo. therefore, we will feel comfortable to stay longer in the royal Rorchid and Condominiums."
"It was my first time I stayed in Royal Orchid Garden Hotel and Condominium. This hotel  is very huge and also have beautiful scenery. Oh oh... the most important one, the air in here is so cool and fresh. So, when u open up ur balcony's door in morning time, the air is so fresh. I choose superior class with my family (my mom, my sis and my big bro exactly), and I just say ""wooooow"" this room is very very make me comfort. This hotel is near with so many tourism, I recommend this hotel if u come to Batu,Malang. Ciao..."
"Orchids Garden Hotel & Condominium is a smart choice for Malang traveler. It was so nice after travelling the region to find a lovely restful and almost healing place. I loved its environs and locations. I booked it via HotelQuickly, with USD 15 off in booking. This discount is applicable for another traveler with my invite code GH17E4X. The hotel lies 15.0 km from the city center. The city's main attractions such as Apple Orchard, Songgoriti Hotspring,  Batu Night Spectacular (BNS) within close reach.  Ii was a great experience for me - so lovely hide-away from the busy world,  but   close to town center. Great gardens and beautiful swimming area!  My room had a balcony with a mountain view. That was great and relaxing feel with beautiful view of mount Arjuna. It was indeed"
"I ever stay in Royal Orchid Garden Hotel and Condominium and I choose superior class. I was happy and comfortable stay here, although I choose superior class but the room's like the executive class. The room is clean and beautiful set up. I want to say thanks to Mr Moko, he is executive housekeeping here. He makes beautiful animal hand towel in my room. He is so kind man, I like it so much. In the other way, during I stay here, I get so many facilities. for the example, I can swim in paradise swimming pool, I can have breakfast and lunch at singashari restaurant. I am happy stay here and thank you so much."
"Booked the Catalya room which has a living room and separate 2 bedrooms. Not exactly luxury, but clean and well kept. There is a lot to park the car right next to door, which is convenient if you have lot of luggage to haul. Breakfast had a good selection of local foods - some limitations what comes to international offerings but nevertheless hotel has put some efforts on it. Try to manage to get a seat by the terrace section with a mountain view. Altogether staff were trying to accommodate any need or request, I would say this was one of the areas hotel needs focus more. Especially room service left lot to improve. Any order, regardless how simple, would require repeating both the actual order and room number at least 3 to 4 times - even when made in local language! This"
"I was staying with my friends in Christmas. It was nice and they have big room to hold us. The hotels also near with Jatim Park and BNS, great place to go when you have more time. The hotel clean enough and good taste of food."
"We were staying at superior room. The room were large enough and clean with balcony but no living room. The room was located near lobby. They provide wide car park. The surrounding was great, very relaxing."
"My favorite moment is when I sat and enjoy meal at restaurant, while I saw the mountains from the restaurant's balcony and feel the cold breeze. It's great while see the scenery while talking with dear friends. The swimming pool is wide and clean. The room is very clean and the staffs service are ok. Highly recommended if you want to enjoy the Batu's scenery and also a strategic place to going around the city."
"We stayed at the royal orchid for 2 nights in December. The location is perfect with a walk through out the back to good view and fresh air in malang. The staff were all amazing and went out of their way to do anything for you, just little things like the big greetings when they saw us and opening of doors when they seen us approaching the door. A particular thanks for coming who picked us up from the airport and continued to make us feel welcome during out stay. The rooms are beautiful and always very clean. The room service was reasonably priced, very nice and very quick as was the restaurant. The breakfast each morning was also lovely and fresh. Would most definitely stay again :)"
"to celebrate the holiday weekand, i'm with my family go to Batu city, really long distance vacation ever we go by land. when it my wife chose royal orchid garden hotel for stay for 3 nights. when we arrive, all staff front office greeted us with friendly, and when i question about route to the tourist destination in batu, they give me information with a completely. my room type in the superior with mount Arjuno and garden view, very nice garden with much kind of bird, my son very loved playing in the play ground. for the breakfast there is plenty of food served in the restaurant when we were having breakfast,  i think royal orchid garden make perfect my holiday in Batu"
"(+) great service, express check in and check out, friendly and smiley staff, good breakfast, beautiful outdoor area (-) room backdoor need more security key, dirt in bathroom no 228, need double room key"
Room - average (no AC)..we stayed in room 123 to 127.. Bathroom - bit dirty..some spots will need repair.. Breakfast - average.. Swimming pool - average. Staff - ok.. Overall - average.. Value to money - average..
"Nice place, vintage kind of hotel. Just got a promotional price. 3 nights for US$180 breaky included during holiday. Awesome. If you love cottage with garden view balcony/terrace. They also have warmed swimming pool and proper service attendance."
"Was stay for one night with 7 family member, was stay at 203 condominium, the bedroom was ok far from the noise and nice view of mountain, but no air con and the main door is broken cannot lock them, the sink in the living room broken as well.   Very big hotel and nice garden plus play ground and large swimming pool. The breakfast was nice. Its only 5 mins drive to alun alun batu and less than 10 mins drive to songgoriti and BNS.  We will probably come back again."
"We didnt really have any high expectation with the hotel but it was surprisingly not a bad choice at all. Big swimming pools area which I think kids would love although we didnt get to try it. Good room size with comfortable bed. We got a room with a balcony, but unfortunately it was facing the main street which could get quite noisy with cars and motors passing around. Breakfast was standard. No aircon but with Batu cool temperature, its not really a problem. Overall, quite a nice experience, good rates, and we will be staying here again when we go back to Batu, Malang."
"This hotel has no air conditioner. Even though Batu air is cool enough for most Indonesians, it may not be cool enough for everybody. Room and hotel decor are old. Breakfast is an embarrassment for a place known for its local delicacies. Water is not hot late in the evening. Bathroom quite dirty and the shower door is broken.   On the plus side, the swimming pool is nice enough and the gardens are pretty well-maintained."
I don't really like this hotel. The room is not very clean and the ambience is scary at night. The most aweful thing is the bathroom. Nasty. Breakfast buffet tastes very so so. I don't recommend this hotel.
"Between the lack of air conditioning, the croaking of the frogs, and the cats mating call, the beds are creaky, the sheets rough as sackcloth, and you have to fork out close to $50/night. Never stay here if you're single or with somebody. Whoever runs this hotel didn't properly reinvest the profits from its former glory days. Pitiful place, really. Don't be fooled by the newly renovated lobby either."
"This is our favorite hotel for staying in batu, malang. we got all inclusive service, from morning till night, breakfast so yummy, afternoon tea so tasty, and off course dinner made my tank do full. Night entertainment so lightfull, there were karaoke and dancing activity, what ever you like. The swimming pools, hmmm big enough for hundred. I love the garden, I could sat and saw so many beautifull birds and fishs. So it was our perfect holiday staying there. Im highly recommend to stay. The hotel is closed to others interest place in batu. Well, I cant wait to start my next holiday there."
"This is old hotel may need some renovation but well maintained. A classic hotel with swimming pool as the centre on its ground and open space area facing the mountain scenery is good facility on this hotel. Others hotel may only have small pool, indoor etc but this hotel grand pool with icy blue water indeed making temptation for us to enjoy it. Although location is in small street, but its fit perfectly facing the mountain. Also the restaurant and open concept sedign of this hotel, make us very comfy with fres mountain's air well circulated. The food on restaurant is average and rooms is average, clean but some may need renovation. Try to order cofee or tea with snack and enjoy the pool view from restaurant."
"This hotel has some plus and minus. Made me confuse how should I rate this hotel. I arrived at new year. My husband and I were looking some short getaway for new year. The weather has not been really nice. Raining everyday. So I intentionally looked for hotels that have a good view and surrounding. therefor even though it's raining I could stay in the hotel and still having a good time. and I found this hotel in tripadvisor.  So I checked in. Room is available. I took a room with a front view to Mt. Banyak, where people usually play paragliding. Room itself is OK. Clean enough for me. Old style of design but it's OK. Although the red painting in one side of the wall was disturbing. But the reason I picked this hotel is really the view to my fav mountain, Mt. Arjuna. From the"
"we stayed only one night in this Resort, everything is same as we had stayed here 2 year ago. there was not much renovation. The room still same, very basic and nothing special the only difference is now they install a large screen flat Television to change the old one. the room is not provide with aircon that is getting more essential for now because the weather in Batu is getting hotter every year. because of that we slept with windows wide open, and it is not comfortable because  we could hear the noise from outside. the pool is old and need for renovation so does the main building. the service is poor, could be because lack of the staff in one shift. one the good point was they had change their breakfast menu. their breakfast menu now is more varieties than before, including"
"The room is very simple. We still need a key to open the door. The bathroom is also very basic. BUT... the simplicity makes this hotel a unique one. With a breathtaking view outside the windows combine with the big swimming pool downstairs, you don't really need a modern touch at all.  Great breakfast too. Again, don't expect any modern menus. But we love it.   The only tiny question is: do they need to ask your pin when we pay with credit card? It's a little unussual, at least for us. You don't share your pin with others. Right? :)"
"Stay for 1 night in this hotel, booking and check in was done in hassle free effort. The room itself is pretty basic, not much to say. One thing to note is breath taking mountain view that surronded the hotel.   Food is another big plus in this hotel where it has distinguished way to present some traditional food, which i found very interesting,   I do hope they improve by providing a ramp instead of stairs for easy walking if you bring big and heavy luggage  overall it was ok experience."
"i stay at this hotel 3 times per year, always book a condominium with 3 floor. on the 1st floor, there's 2 way door, and car garage, kitchen and television area where we can hang out while make a tea or coffee. on the 2nd floor there's 3 bedroom with only one bathroom, which is not enough, but the temperature was low, it's cold, we prefer to keep as clean as possible to avoid bath, =D, but don't worry, they have hot water if you prefer to take a bath. my favorite area is 3rd floor area. there's only 1 bedroom there, but it's wide, the ceiling is high, this room is under the roof, yea it's more like the loft for short. there's a tv again with sofa we can have a party here. the bathroom was old, but its clean and functionally well. the have garden and many kind of bird, so when"
"Looking for a nice hotel in Batu we entered the Royal Orchids Garden Hotel. Because it was a long trip van Bali to Malang we arrived in the late evening and decided to book a room for 1 night. The next morning was surprising! Mountainview, largest swimmingpool ever, good breakfast and friendly service. We decided to stay 2 nights longer and changed the Mountain View room for a Extravaganza room. Little bit more space and comfort. The hotel fullfilled all our wished so at the end we stayed for 6 nights. The Hotel is a good start for sightseeing in Batu, a place with many options and activities surrounded by nature."
"This is hotel is so terrible, it makes other terrible ones look like an amateur.  I arranged meeting in this place simply because other hotels are fully booked. The correspondences were horrible. They didn't promptly reply your emails, and just generally louzy at communicating.  I provided them all the details needed for the meeting.  But on day one, the door to the meeting room was shut. We waited for an HOUR before it was opened, and they didn't prepare ANYTHING. Not even a single glass of coffee, or electrical plug extensions.  They even refused to provide us with LCD projector because, they said, it was not requested. A complete blatant lie because they charged $100 a day for it after we requested LCD projector usage for 3 days.  I also turns out that they had mugged us"
"The hotel is strategically located , it's very close to major attractions ; BNS , Jatim Park , Kusuma Agro ,Selecta (5 mins drive max), and yet it still maintains its serenity and privacy :) The hotel offers rooms and a few condominiums. We rented the condominium with 2 bedrooms with king sized beds ( love the high ceilings), a bathroom, a living room, and a dining room. It was clean, well-maintained - no faulty electricity and everything is in place and working well-, bathroom is old but clean and functional- , spacious ( 3 storeys- 1st floor the living area, bedrooms on 2nd and 3rd floor) , and the back door of the condo  bring guests directly to the hotel's garden with its mini zoo and children playground. Breakfasts and dinners are included in the package. The breakfasts"
Orchids Royal Garden Hotel is a very nice hotel and perfect for family vacations. Breakfast and dinner are delicious. Service is good and quite complete facilities. But unfortunately the size of the rooms are too small (for standard rooms) and fitness center is under construction. The price is also considered expensive compared to competitors. Need a little renovation to the bathroom because it already looks outdated
"(+) great service, express check in and check out, friendly and smiley staff, good breakfast, beautiful outdoor area (-) room backdoor need more security key, dirt in bathroom no 228, need double room key"
Room - average (no AC)..we stayed in room 123 to 127.. Bathroom - bit dirty..some spots will need repair.. Breakfast - average.. Swimming pool - average. Staff - ok.. Overall - average.. Value to money - average..
"Nice place, vintage kind of hotel. Just got a promotional price. 3 nights for US$180 breaky included during holiday. Awesome. If you love cottage with garden view balcony/terrace. They also have warmed swimming pool and proper service attendance."
"Was stay for one night with 7 family member, was stay at 203 condominium, the bedroom was ok far from the noise and nice view of mountain, but no air con and the main door is broken cannot lock them, the sink in the living room broken as well.   Very big hotel and nice garden plus play ground and large swimming pool. The breakfast was nice. Its only 5 mins drive to alun alun batu and less than 10 mins drive to songgoriti and BNS.  We will probably come back again."
"We didnt really have any high expectation with the hotel but it was surprisingly not a bad choice at all. Big swimming pools area which I think kids would love although we didnt get to try it. Good room size with comfortable bed. We got a room with a balcony, but unfortunately it was facing the main street which could get quite noisy with cars and motors passing around. Breakfast was standard. No aircon but with Batu cool temperature, its not really a problem. Overall, quite a nice experience, good rates, and we will be staying here again when we go back to Batu, Malang."
